# NavScripts

Here you can find all most of my user scripts for Chrome or Firefox.

## Let's start

To begin, you will need to download a browser extension :
 - [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), if you are using Chrome
 - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), if you are using Firefox

After that, you only need to navigate throught all the differents folder of this repository to choose which user script you need. So just click on it, and click on the `Raw` button for installing it !

If you want also my personnal filters for my Adblocker, just import the following line :
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ludovicm67/NavScripts/master/AdBLocker_custom_rules.txt`
to your AdBlocker's filters list.

That's it ! :wink:
